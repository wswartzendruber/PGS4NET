# PGS4NET

## Introduction

The purpose of this library is to someday facilitate intuitive interaction with Presentation
Graphics Stream (PGS) subtitles, often times referred to as SUP subtitles due to their file
extension.

In it's current, early state, it only supports reading and writing individual segments.

## Example

Basic use is illustrated below as seen in the `PGS4NET.Examples.SegmentDump` project:

```csharp
using PGS4NET;

if (args.Length != 1)
    throw new ArgumentException("A single parameter with a PGS file must be passed.");

using var pgsStream = new FileStream(args[0], FileMode.Open);

while (pgsStream.Position < pgsStream.Length)
{
    var segment = pgsStream.ReadSegment();

    switch (segment)
    {
        case PresentationCompositionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("PCS");
            break;
        case WindowDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("WDS");
            break;
        case PaletteDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("PDS");
            break;
        case SingleObjectDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("S-ODS");
            break;
        case InitialObjectDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("I-ODS");
            break;
        case MiddleObjectDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("M-ODS");
            break;
        case FinalObjectDefinitionSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("F-ODS");
            break;
        case EndSegment:
            Console.WriteLine("ES");
            break;
        default:
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Segment is of unhandled type.");
    }
}
```

Segments can be written out to streams via the `WriteSegment` extension method on the
`System.IO.Stream` class.
